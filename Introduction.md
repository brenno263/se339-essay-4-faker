### Introduction
Testing is an important aspect of coding, and generating data by hand is tedious.
Thus, Faker, which generates data for you, is a widely used package to generate realistic fake data.
Faker is implemented in many different languages, including Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, and JavaScript.
Faker PHP was one of the most popular open-source packages, but it was eventually [archived](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) due to its architectural flaws by the repository owner.
Another popular open-source version is Faker JS.
The Faker JS team has worked to create a much more modern, modular, and automated code base than any other before it, and they have big plans going forwards. 
The Faker JS team has released their [road map](https://fakerjs.dev/about/roadmap/v8.html), outlining their concerns and planned remedies.


- good for the past section
A group of contributors forked the [repository](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker) to try and continue its development.

- note that this bit is great but should end up in a different section
After the original repository (the owner deleted) was recovered and a core team of contributors backed Faker, the Faker team continued its development, noting the pitfalls of Faker PHP to avoid failing for the same reasons.
A big difference between the PHP repository (the archive one) and the JS repository is the use of GitHub actions.
Faker JS takes advantage of them to increase the automation of the review code review process.
Furthermore, Faker is taking action to restructure using Tree Shaking for their next big release.
