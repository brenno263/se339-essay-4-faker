This section will focus on where Faker is currently developing. 

Let us start by looking at version 6 of Faker, which is demarked by the project being rewritten in typescript, adding documentation, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, and beginning to make major bug fixes regarding the implementation.
Towards the end of version 6, new features such as random IMEI numbers and MongoDB ObjectId generation. 

Version 7 saw the Faker team overhauling the project again with continual code cleanup and improvements. 
The ground was broken by removing code that had become deprecated, targeting es2020, and dropping support for Node v12, amongst other things. 

As of version 7.5, most changes have been improving documentation, removing unused code, reducing code duplication, updating dependencies, and adding highly requested new features. 

Currently, Faker sits at version 7.6 and has begun making major preparations for its version 8 release, in which it will undergo tree shaking.
