Faker's foreseeable future lies in Tree-Shaking, a process where dead code is removed. For Faker specifically, this comes in the form of version 8.0. Various changes
and improvements such as removing circular dependencies, renaming and moving modules, as well as standardizing function parameters are taking place. 

The final goal of this effort is to make Faker even more modular then it already is. This is best shown in splitting the Faker class into smaller units.
In its current form, you must download the entirety of Faker in order to utilize it. This causes un-needed data types to be unnecessarily included.
Thus, version 8.1 seeks to rectify this and allow you to only download what you need. In addition to usability improvments, this will reduce the file size for Faker dramatically.
