In this section I will talk about where Faker is at currently in terms of its development. Its important to keep in consideration the past of Faker, in all its
forms. 

Faker PHP was sunsetted due to design limitations. The creator of PHP faker, noted that the project was relatively large, sitting at 3 mb, and was used for 
automated testing, which meant it was being downloaded quite frequently. To be specific, the creator estimated that the project was downloaded around 121 million
times around the time of the sunset announcement. 121 M x 3 = 363 Million MB. 

This may seem inconsequential to most, but its important for all of us as developers to keep in mind our impact on the planet we live on. Its estimated that PHP
Faker has contributed over 11 metric tons of Co2 over the its lifetime. It doesnt take a climate scientist to know this is a concerning amount of emssions.
