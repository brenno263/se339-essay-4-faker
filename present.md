This section focuses on current developments in Faker JS (hereafter referred to as simply Faker).

The present version of Faker differs from the past Faker in several ways. Namely a dedicated source and documentation folder, as well as several key integrations that allow Faker to be automated. The current documentation is of much higher quality as well. Faker currently has a much more organized folder structure and many more configuration files that enable it to be automated efficiently.

Let us move on to the most recent versions of Faker, starting with version 6, which is demarked by the project being rewritten in typescript, adding documentation, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, and beginning to make major bug fixes regarding the implementation.
Towards the end of version 6, new features such as random IMEI numbers and MongoDB ObjectId generation were added. 

Version 7 saw the Faker team overhauling the project again with continual code cleanup and improvements. 
The ground was broken by removing code that had become deprecated, targeting es2020, and dropping support for Node v12, amongst other things. 

As of version 7.5, most changes have centered around improving documentation, removing unused code, reducing code duplication, updating dependencies, and adding highly requested new features. 

Currently, Faker sits at version 7.6 and has begun making major preparations for its version 8 release, in which its modules will be refactored to better support tree shaking.
